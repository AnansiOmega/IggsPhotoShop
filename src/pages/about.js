                The idea behind this website is to test my skills in creating
                an e-commerce website. Unfortunately, I have nothing to sell, so by adding these photos to your cart and
                purchasing them you are making a donation for the phenomenal work that I've been doing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, I've given you the ability to download any photo you'd like to your computer. Lastly, if you feel like making
                an account (which is not mandatory.) You will have the ability to like photography. So have at it. Try to have some fun.
                Maybe send some money to me. Or don't. It's fine.
